        Meet the Director of Somali’s Reporting Center an ex-wife of one of
        Al-Shabab leaders
      </h1>

      <p class="center">
        Greetings, my fellow Somali brothers and sisters in Somalia and around
        the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did you know Somalia ranks among the world’s most corrupt countries in
        the world? Somalia’s Corruption Perception Index increased to 13 index
        points in 2021. According to the 2021 Corruption Perception Index report
        by Transparency International, Somalia falls 178 the least corrupt
        nation out of 180 countries. I would say without any hesitation that FRC
        is the most corrupt and unjust government institution in Somalia. You
        might be asking yourself why I am making such a bold statement naming
        FRC the most corrupt government institution in Somalia.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this report, you will know what’s going on behind FRC’S closed doors.
        What I am going to say in this report is nothing but the truth and I
        only speak of my own experiences. Consequently, everything I tell you in
        this report is my truth and what I have witnessed and experienced behind
        the walls of FRC. I am a Somali citizen that lives and works in
        Mogadishu, Banadir Somalia. I work for Somalia’s Financial Reporting
        Centre known as FRC. The reason I decided to write this report and speak
        up now is that things are getting worse day after day at FRC. I can no
        longer keep silent about the corruption and unjust I witness every day.
        I passionately hate corruption and injustice. I might not have the power
        to make any changes but, have the power to expose the evildoers. As
        stated above, everything I am sharing with you in this report is
        something I have seen and heard in first-hand experience. Most
        importantly, it is an open secret, all the employees know what is going
        on, but are afraid to speak up for fear of losing their livelihood.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you google FRC, you will learn that the official director of this
        institution is Amina Mohamed Ali. So, who is Amina Mohamed Ali? Amina is
        a U.K. citizen and came to Somalia in 2008, but was born and raised in
        Baidhabo. She is from the Rahanwanye tribe. Her husband is MP, her
        father was MP in the previous Farmajo government. Everyone knows Amina
        including the International community (World Bank, State Department,
        IMF, etc) that she was once married to one of the Al-Shabab leaders.
        This information is only known by certain people and is held at the
        military court by a man named Shoote. Yet, she is the director of
        Somalia’s Financial Intelligent Unit. She is the director of Somalia’s
        Financial Reporting Centre which claims it is fighting terrorism, and
        corruption, and going after foreign and domestic politically exposed
        persons. She was married to a terrorist leader, her father was MP for
        southwest for the last 5 years, and her current husband is MP. No
        government would permit such a person to be the director of a country’s
        financial intelligence unit. First, she has had a link to a terrorist
        group. Second, her husband Nuh is a domestic politically exposed person
        (MP), and her father was a domestic politically exposed person (MP).
        This is unconstitutional and a conflict of interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        She owns more than eight Villas in Mogadishu, Abdi Aziz district Lido
        beach. She owns a mansion home in Badhabo, which she goes to enjoy every
        single month to get away from Mogdishu’s chaos as she puts it. She
        travels to the U.K. whenever she feels it’s unsafe to stay in Mogadishu.
        She travelled to the U.K. twice last year. She owns a spa called
        Cleopatra Lounge (29R6+VCC, Sanna Rd, Mogadishu, Somalia, 252 61
        9500087). She also owns multiple construction businesses. One of them is
        called Ibtisam, which she named after her daughter. She owns the
        security company at Badhabo airport. She has a contract from the
        southwest government to train their security intelligence. She has so
        many organizations and schools I can’t list all of their names in this
        report. However, she claims them to be non-profit, but it is not. She
        has endless businesses and properties in Somalia. She just now opened a
        new e-commerce business and Tech consultant company called TTL. This is
        a newly created company. She asked Ahmed Said (IT mentor at FRC) to
        create a website and Guleid Osman (compliance mentor at FRC) to get the
        business license and everything else they need from government
        institutions. So, to make the business legit, Ahmed Said hired a guy on
        behalf of Amina and rented a desk and a chair from a business that he
        knows. Then, when the IT company that FRC hired to deliver electronic
        equipment called the FRC admin department to confirm the delivery date,
        they were told that they must go through TTL which is a third-party
        company FRC uses. The company understood FRC’s dirty job by asking them
        to go through a third party company that they were never advised of. The
        IT company advised FRC, they will not go through a third-party company
        because that was not on the contract. Another example of Amina’s
        corruption is that FRC received two bulletproof cars last year. Amina
        gave away the previous FRC’s black bulletproof car to one of her elite
        friends, took one for herself, and gave the other one to her ex-husband
        Omar Mohamed Sharif (FRC’s head of administration).
      </p>

      <p>
        Her tribal men run the administration department, and they are all
        cousins. Omar Mohamed Sharif, Mohamed Sharif Roble, Abdisalam Sheikh
        Ali, and a new guy that Mohamed Sharif (his cousin) hired last year (he
        was not introduced to the employee, but he’s part of the management). No
        one is allowed to have access to any important information like finance
        except these three men. For example, the last financial advisor FRC had
        was not allowed to see any of the institutions’ financial statements or
        anything else that he needed to do his job. We are all forced to come to
        work from 8:00–5 PM but don’t do anything. Amina’s monthly salary is
        $20,000 from the State Department (U.S. Justice Department) and
        $8,000.00 from the Somalia government. She only does FRC work when she
        needs to give an update to the World Bank Group and the State Department
        (The American Justice Department). She will fire anyone that she feels
        is a threat to her job. If you don’t say Yes, Amina, and don’t agree
        with her ideas, she will make your life a living hell, then fire you.
        Everyone at FRC knows her infamous spy Amin Isak Amin. Employees are
        afraid to talk when he is around regardless of their employment status.
        He’s related to her, and she pays him more than all the other civil
        servants at FRC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year November, she changed the one-month paid vacation to two
        weeks. The two weeks paid vacation only applies to employees that are
        not in the same tribe as her (aka Rahanwayn tribe). For example, two
        different employees from two different departments requested to take
        their vacation and gave the reason they need it. At FRC, you must tell
        management why you need to take your annual vacation, even though you
        know they will decline your request. So, they did what they do best and
        gave the Rahanwayn employee Adiwahab Mohamed Abdirahman approval for his
        annual vacation because the new rule doesn’t apply to them (Rahanwayn
        tribe). There was another employee who also requested to take her annual
        vacation but got only two weeks’ approval after her IT mentor pleaded
        her case. She sent a letter from a hospital advising the HR department
        that she is in a hospital and needs two more weeks. But Amina told the
        HR team to advise the employee if she doesn’t come back, she will be
        fired and will immediately hire someone else for her position. Amina
        rehired the employee after someone reported the wrongful dismissal to
        the employee’s MP. As far as we know all civil servants are entitled to
        one month of paid vacation. The question we all have is who has given
        Amina the power to change a vacation policy set by Somalia’s Minister of
        Labour and Social Affairs from one month to two weeks? Amina thinks FRC
        is one of her businesses and doesn’t believe her job is to serve the
        Somali people. On December 21, 2022, this same girl requested to leave
        early as she was not feeling well and wanted to go home. One of the HR
        team informed Amina and got fired immediately. Amina and her tribal men
        get unlimited time off, but other FRC employees can’t even go home if
        they’re not feeling well for half a day.
      </p>

      <p>
        She hired a Deputy Director but didn’t introduce him to anyone at FRC.
        She didn’t want NAMLC (National Anti-Money Laundering Committee) to know
        even though she meets them every month. Unfortunately, she fired him
        after she learned a new Deputy Director is coming to FRC from the
        President’s office. When Amina realized the new deputy director is for
        sure coming to FRC without her permission, she ordered the IT team to
        remove the current power structure and replace it with the new one. She
        made sure the IT team removed it from the annual report, and FRC’s
        website and took down the frame hanging in the hallway that shows the
        old power structure. I encourage you to compare FRC’s previous reporting
        structure and the new one. Everyone knows, she will only hire someone if
        she can exchange a favour with the person asking her to employ someone
        for them. For example, the previous attorney general Sulayman Mohamed
        Mohamud wanted Amina to hire Abdigani Jama. In exchange, she will get
        his vote when her five years term ends in May 2021. So, she hired
        Adbigani Jama in December 2020 and he was there for more than one year
        getting paid $16,000 a month, one month of paid vacation, and paid
        roundtrip ticket. He has not accomplished anything but used to claim he
        has met with other government institutions regarding the AML/CFT
        regulations. Then, by mid-2021 summer, Abdigani and Amina were not on
        talking terms. Consequently, he will come to work at 10:30 and leave at
        1:30 pm. He did nothing except browse social media and talk on the
        phone. At the end of each month, until his contract ended in February
        2022, he will make up something claiming he has given training and many
        other things and send it to IDILO. We should ask Amina and IDILO to
        produce what Abdigani Jama contributed or accomplished in his time (one
        and a half years) at FRC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most Somalis and the International Community (IMF, World Bank Group &
        U.S State department) are unaware how Amina gave herself another 5 years
        term on May 11, 2021, when her position never got posted for fair
        competition. Amina knew who will vote for her and when to set up the
        NAMLC meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who are the NAMLC ( (National Anti-Money Laundering Committee) members?
      </p>

      <p>Minister of Finance (Committee Chairperson)</p>

      <p>Minister of Justice</p>

      <p>Minister of Internal Security</p>

      <p>Minister of Commerce and Industry</p>

      <p>Director General of National Intelligence and Security Agency</p>

      <p>Governor of the Central Bank of Somalia</p>

      <p>Attorney General</p>

      <p>Director of Financial Reporting Center, FRC (Committee Secretary)</p>

      <p>
        Has anyone ever asked why FRC never investigated Forex trader’s scam?
        Amina refused the Forex trader’s scam to be investigated because she and
        Sadiq John took money from a couple of traders and let them go. She has
        all the laptops they confiscated, but it is collecting dust in her
        office. She doesn’t want anyone to investigate or talk to her about it.
        She uses extortion and bribe to get whatever she wants from Somali
        Banks, Hawalas, and Businesses. She threatens the Somali Banks and
        Hawalas to give her money every month or she will incriminate them of
        terrorist financing and close their businesses. We the Somali people
        know that the Somali Banks, Hawalas, and businesses are the backbone of
        our economy and rebuilding our country and creating jobs for our people.
        She was reported to the previous government for misconduct. When she
        came to know about it, she went to see her tribal MPs to get to work as
        always. The Rahanwayne MPs went to see Farmajo and asked to leave their
        daughter alone and used their usual tactics. Last year alone, she got
        reported twice by all the Somali banks, Hawalas, and businesses to
        President Hassan Sheikh. Finally, President Hassan Sheikh’s advisor
        Hussein Mo’alin (Amina’s best friend also from the U.K) requested to
        keep her until January because she’s on the board of directors for his
        spy agency Sahan. For those Somali people that don’t know what Sahan
        does, let me tell you what kind of agency Sahan is. It is a spy agency
        that Hussein Mo’alin started which claims it is a non-profit
        organization. Former president Farmajo expelled this organization
        (Sahan) and some people he knew were spies. But, as soon as President
        Hassan Sheikh came into power, they all came back to Somalia and got
        back to work. Hussein Mo’alin “choose” a deputy director for FRC this
        month. However, this poor new deputy director doesn’t know that Husein
        Moalin knows Amina wants to “choose” the deputy director and set a
        precedent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The minister of finance (Beileh) is a very close friend of hers. The
        Minister of Justice (Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur ) is also a very close
        friend of hers and for the same tribe. She and the Committee Chairperson
        (Minister of Finance) planned out an illegal way to get the Governor of
        the Central Bank & Minister of Internal Security’s vote. She knew the
        Minister of Commerce and Industry will vote for her. The
        Director-General of the National Intelligence and Security Agency and
        Amina hate each other and never showed up at any of the NAMLC’s
        meetings. So, she knew he will never attend and didn’t care. Lastly, the
        Attorney General’s vote was a grantee since he owes her a favor for
        hiring Abdigani Jama for him. Consequently, she set up a meeting within
        a week when she knew the Governor of the Central Bank (he and Amina hate
        each other too) was away and the deputy governor (Maryam Abdulahi Yusuf)
        of the central bank was there. Please note the deputy governor of the
        central bank and Amina hate each other too. On the day of the vote,
        Amina, Omar & Abdisalam went off to the meeting (her right-hand men).
        The meeting went exactly how she and the committee chairperson (Beileh)
        planned. As with any other meeting, Amina and her right-hand men made a
        presentation talking about their usual presentation topic of what is
        AML/CFT. Then, the committee talked about the never-ending conflict
        regarding AML/CFT regulation between FRC & Central Bank.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, the committee chairperson executed his plan and said they
        are voting for Amina to “serve” another five years term. The minister of
        finance and the minister of justice talked about Amina and the
        “wonderful” work she has done for the last five years. They claimed she
        is the only person that can do this job and we must vote for her. The
        person that the minister of commerce and industry sent on his behalf
        spoke up saying he doesn’t anything about AML/CFT and has never heard
        before today. Then, the deputy of the central bank and minister of
        internal security said this is not part of the agenda. Most importantly,
        we need to post the job for fair competition and then vote for the most
        qualified person that can do the job. The finance minister completely
        disregarded the concerns of the internal security minister and the
        deputy governor of the central bank. The finance minister said, we are
        voting for her now and that is the end of the discussion. Everyone
        raised their hands (minister of finance, minister of justice, minister
        of commerce, and industry & attorney general. The deputy governor of the
        central bank and internal security minister felt a lot of pressure from
        the finance minister and gave in. Amina came back to FRC at 12:30 PM
        very excited like a child that got a lot of Eid money. Amina will never
        forget this day because her plan was successfully executed. She said, “I
        am so happy today because I got another five years term that I can do
        whatever I want.” And that is exactly what she started to do and still
        doing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year when Amina realized she was going to lose her job, she tried
        everything to keep her job. Fortunately, this time it didn’t go as she
        planned. She tried to go to America to speak with the people she works
        for and pay her salary (The U.S. Justice Department known as the State
        Department). Disastrously, her visa got declined and she came back to
        Somalia. So, my dearest Somali people, we need to know, why is the
        president not listening to the Somali banks, Halwas, and Businesses, but
        listening to Hussein Mo’ailin. She is one of the wealthiest women in
        Somalia. Don’t be fooled by her cheap abaya or dress. That is just an
        act she puts on in front of everyone to think she doesn’t take anything
        from FRC.
      </p>

      <h2>Meet FRC’s real Director</h2>

      <p>
        Most people think Amina Mohamed Ali is the director at FRC, but that’s
        the wrong assumption. You may ask yourself who then? Let me introduce to
        you the infamous man who’s known as Omar Dhage. Omar Mohamed Sharif aka
        Omar Dhage (Rahanwayn tribe) is the unofficial director at FRC and the
        man that calls all the shots. It is an open secret at FRC, but no one
        dares to say anything because everyone knows if they speak up or go
        against his wrongdoings, they will be fired on the spot. He is the
        ex-husband of FRC’s director Amina Mohamed Ali. He was secretary for
        Sharif Sakin who was the previous president of Southwest. He stole a lot
        of money from his previous employer Sharif Sakin and build himself a
        two-story home at the heart of central Mogadishu). Hence, Amina invited
        him to come work with her at FRC as the “head of Administration.” He is
        the owner of the company FRC contracted out for the security guard. He
        is the owner of the travel agency FRC uses for travel tickets. At the
        end of last year, there was a conference in Kenya that FRC was invited
        to attend. As always, Omar includes himself on every trip to get the
        travel allowance, but at this time, he’s already in Kenya. So, he did
        what he does best. You might ask yourself what crime did he commit at
        this time? He purchases a ticket for himself from Somalia to Kenya to
        get reimbursement for the ticket and to get the allowance. As mentioned
        above, he is the owner of the ticket agency. At every event that FRC
        hosts he makes fake invoices and pockets the money. He did the same
        thing for Somalia’s National Risk Assessment conference held in January
        2021 at Decale hotel and so are the last two goAML conferences held in
        the same location (Decale hotel).
      </p>

      <p>
        For instant, when FRC hosted Somalis’ first national risk assessment,
        FRC estimated it to be $30,000 for one week at Decale hotel. Most
        government officials didn’t stay at the hotel, but FRC claimed they did.
        Omar sent half of the people on the list home and made them sign out on
        Sunday at 11:30 am. So, a couple of employees stayed on Friday night,
        and Saturday (the first day of the conference), and signed out Sunday
        morning. He then asked for a refund for the remaining nights they won’t
        stay at the hotel. Additionally, FRC claimed they would need to rent a
        car for the week of the event, but FRC never rented a car, and their
        employees arranged their transportation. For example, on the third day
        of the conference, FRC employees walked from Decale to Jazera Hotel
        risking their lives to attend two days conference with the Somali banks
        and Hawalas. Another example is FRC hired interpreters on the first day
        of the conference and got paid $300.00. However, FRC claimed $800 on the
        invoice that was sent off to the World Bank Group. They rented a screen
        for the first day of the event from an IT company for $600 but claimed
        $1,500 on the invoice that was sent off to World Bank Group.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year, FRC received a renovation budget of almost $50,000 from the
        World Bank Group. As I mentioned above, Amina has a construction company
        she named after her daughter Ibtisam, but that is not the only
        construction company she has. She renovated the first and second floors
        very poorly and of course her office. Please note, this is the second
        time she’s renovating her office since FRC was established. We don’t
        even have AC (air conditioner) for all the rooms on the second floor.
        What happened to the $50,000 renovation? Where did the money go? In
        addition to this, she requested from the World Bank Group a budget for 3
        people and 3 laptops to help Abdrisaq Godane with the National Risk
        Assessment project. She got a budget for 3 people and 3 laptops, but as
        always, she took the money and the laptops. Abdrisaq Godane knows Amina
        got the budget and laptops from the World Bank Group but can’t say much
        because he needs to keep his job. Everyone at FRC knows her corruption
        and unjust but can’t speak up for fear of losing their job.
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes me cry every night is our stupid Somali leaders from the
        highest to the lowest rank of leaders think the money from the World
        Bank Group is free. They don’t think it is a debt that our future
        children have to pay. They don’t know when the World Bank gives you a
        $10 million loan, they will want $10 billion worth of our country’s
        resources plus interest. Unfortunately, we have in our government
        institutions directors like Amina who will request a budget from the
        World Bank for things like a certificate that costs $1,200. I know Amina
        doesn’t care because she started to build wealth as soon as she came
        into power at FRC. A wealth that she can live off for the rest of her
        natural life like a queen and her great-grandchildren. She built a
        generational wealth for herself and her great-grandchildren. Here is
        another example of FRC’s corruption. FRC went through an audit and
        failed. There are so many people on FRC’s payroll but, who never set
        foot at FRC e.g Amina’s brother and many others. Four people get a
        salary of $6,000, $5,000, and $3,000 as “advisors” etc. Everyone at FRC
        knows that Omar has so many sim cards and a long list of names in his
        desk drawer. You may be asking yourself how come no one has heard this.
        The reason no one heard is that Omar met the head of the audit team that
        came to FRC and bought him off. Amina couldn’t afford scandal as her
        five years term was coming to an end. So, Omar told her he will “fix it”
        (bribe).
      </p>

      <p>
        Omar is the “head of administration and finance” and gets a salary of
        more than $6,000.00. He gets a salary for different roles and on other
        people’s names. He comes and leaves the office whenever he wants. He
        didn’t come to work since the beginning of last year. After leaving FRC,
        Abdigani Jama told everyone that Omar is the one in charge at FRC and
        not Amina. Most importantly, Abdigani told everyone that Omar is Amina’s
        ex-husband, and she does whatever he tells her to do, which is very
        true. In 2022, Omar was in Turkey for half of the year and got his
        salary from Salama bank to his Turkish bank account in Istanbul. Then,
        went to Kenya and still got his full salary in Nairobi (he has a Turkish
        residence and a Kenyan passport). Amina told Omar she doesn’t want him
        to be seen at FRC because she is afraid of her job now. She called Omar
        back to work this month because of the new deputy director. At the end
        of last year, FRC was preoccupied with shredding all the documents Omar
        signed and many other important documents. He enjoyed in Kenya driving a
        $45,000 car, while some employees I know can’t even take Bajaj after
        work as they can’t afford both ways. They get $700 a month and 75% of
        their salary goes to rent as they can’t live anywhere in the city
        because of where they work (FRC). Also, employees would get fired if
        they insisted to get personal time off. Last year, one of FRC’s
        employees, requested time off and told them he is getting married. They
        told him verbally his time off is approved but called him back the
        following day and said his request got denied. He requested to speak
        with the director since the HR team gave him the runaround. His request
        to see the director got denied and was told the director doesn’t want to
        see him and he is fired.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone at FRC knows Omar is a misogynist and sexually abuses the women
        that work at FRC. Starting from the girl sitting at the entrance that
        pats down the women, and caretakers, including the old lady that cooks
        the food. If they refuse his requests, he will threaten to fire them.
        One of the caretakers got fired last year because she got “pregnant out
        of wedlock.” She tried to plead her case telling them she got married a
        couple of months ago. But her pleading fell on a deaf ear and was told
        we don’t want in our workplace a woman that is carrying a bastard child.
        So, as always, the HR team falsified the document they submit to the
        government as these two employees are no longer employed at FRC. Another
        girl went on maternity leave in 2020 and when she came back to work
        pregnant again, she got fired telling her “she is having babies like
        chicken.” Whenever they fire an employee, the HR will fabricate a lie
        and get it signed by people like Mohamed Idris (head of the security
        guard) and Hassan (logistics), and one or two employees that are loyal
        to them. In 2021, Omar decided some employees should get a salary
        increase. Those are employees are non but his own family/tribe. He gave
        a salary increase to Amin Izak Amin (Amina’s spy boy and relative),
        Adiwahab Mohamed Abdirahman (Rahanwayn) Zeinabn (Omar’s cousin), etc.
        When other employees asked why they also didn’t get a salary increase.
        They were told, they can leave now if they are not happy with what they
        got now. Then, Omar & Amina called the “elite employees” into Omar’s
        office and scold them and were told they shouldn’t have shared with
        other employees salary increases.

        Abdisalam Sheikh Ali (Rahanwayn tribe) is one (the “second in command”)
        of the administration team. He used to get a salary for two different
        roles. He was FRC’s head of HR, the compliance department team lead, and
        some other roles. Then, last year he went to Ethiopia and bought an
        Ethiopian passport. Then, Amina told the previous FRC’s financial
        advisor that his contract can’t be renewed because FRC didn’t get a
        budget from “the World Bank Group.” Aydarus who works with the admin
        department applied and told Amina he’s interested in applying for the
        financial advisor’s position. However, Amina told him this position is
        for Somalis who have Western Passports. However, as soon as Abdisalam
        got his Ethiopian passport, she gave him the job as FRC’s “financial
        advisor.” Consequently, Abdisalam gets paid $4,500 a month.

        Mohamed Sharif Roble (Rahanwayn tribe) works for FRC and Amina’s Spa
        business and gets paid $2,500 a month. He takes care of FRC’s employee
        payroll and Amina’s business logistics and whatever else she requests
        him to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amin Izak Amin (Rahanwayn tribe) is the director’s spy boy and relative.
        He used to work for NASA before Amina asked him to come work with her.
        His monthly salary is $1,400 a month. She appointed him the team lead
        for the analyst department when she came to find out she might no longer
        be FRC’s director.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adiwahab Mohamed Abdirahman (Rahanwayn tribe) used to work for NISA
        before she brought him to FRC. He gets paid $1,050 a month. Just like
        Amin Izak Amin, she appointed him to be the Compliance department team
        lead when she came to find out she might no longer be FRC’s director.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zeinab (Rahanwayn tribe) is Omar’s cousin and gets paid $1050 a month.
        She also got married recently, but she never lost her job. She had a
        miscarriage and was given unlimited time off to heal. She then got
        pregnant and went off on maternity leave for a long time, unlike all the
        other women at FRC. She didn’t have to worry about job security because
        her cousin is the “head of the admin department.”

        Ahmed Said is FRC’s IT mentor and gets paid $14,000 a month. He has been
        with FRC since 2019 and is also from the U.K. Every month he would claim
        he gave training to the IT team when he didn’t. He forces his IT support
        person to also include it in his monthly report. He will use the same
        training material occasionally because he doesn’t know what to put in
        his monthly report. Some of the IT team are more knowledgeable than him
        and are always correcting him. They’re the ones that do everything more
        specifically his IT support person. The IT team knows that he lies about
        what he does in his monthly report. Whatever needs to be done, he tells
        the IT team support person to get it done. He googles everything and
        puts it together for training material. IDILO never bother to check his
        recycled training material.

        Guleid Osman is FRC’s Compliance department mentor and gets paid $12,000
        a month. He has been with FRC since October 2020 and is also from the
        U.K. He deals with Somalia’s banks and Hawalas. He gets his training
        material from the internet and has no AML/CFT experience. He doesn’t
        have any certification, qualification, or practical experience to teach
        AML/CFT. He also uses the same training material to teach the Compliance
        department what is AML/CFT without giving them any practical example
        that is relevant in Somalia.
      </p>

      <p>
        I and all the Somali people want to know what the State Department and
        the World Bank Group are going to do now since someone shed light on
        FRC’s corruption, fraud, money laundering, extortion, and injustice. Do
        the State Department and World Bank support corruption, fraud, money
        laundering, extortion, human rights abuse (sexual abuse), and workplace
        harassment?
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. President Hassan Sheikh, last month in your Friday khutbah you
        talked about the unprecedented corruption happening in the government
        institutions in Somalia. The Somali people want to know, what are you
        going to do now that you know what is going on at FRC? Are you going to
        investigate, and take an action against the people in your government
        and fight for justice? Will you listen and advocate for Amina’s victims
        (FRC employees, Somalis banks, Hawala, and Businesses) or you’re going
        to listen to Hussein Moalin and turn a blind eye as you did before?
